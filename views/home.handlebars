<h3>Database Info</h3>
<div id="scrollbox">
<p>This database will allow multiple users to capture information about restaurants and restaurant visits that they have made. Users will be able to provide a comprehensive review for a restaurant, which is the expectation for a restaurant review tool; however, they will also be able to review individual menu items from a restaurant. To be clear, users will be able to write two, distinct types of review:</p> 

<ol>
	<li>A comprehensive review intended to capture the userâ€™s overall evaluation of a particular restaurant</li>
	<li>A review of a particular menu item at a given restaurant</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, a user could optionally include information about specific menu items in their comprehensive review. However, my family and I often find ourselves making informal reviews about a specific item at a favorite restaurant and would like a tool to weigh in on that item alone and be able to reference it later.</p>

<p>	This database will also allow users to enter information about a specific visit to a restaurant. Reviews of both types can optionally reference this visit. The intent here is to allow a user to track their experience with a certain restaurant (or a certain menu item) over time.</p>
